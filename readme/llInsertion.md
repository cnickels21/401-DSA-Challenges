# Linked List Insertion

To work with a linked list, you need to be able to traverse the linked list, access values, and you definitely want to be able to insert values at any given point in the linked list.  Imagine a list of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 5.  You want to go back and insert 4 in the proper place.  That's what we accomplished in today's DSA.

## Challenge

There were a couple of particular challenges to accomplish today.  Firstly, insert an item at the end of a list.  Secondly, given a value, insert an item into the list either before or after the given value accordingly.

## Approach and Efficiency

My partner and I spent about a half an hour conceptualizing and white boarding how our solution would be for appending at the end of a list.  This gave us some good insight as to how we would insert in the middle as well.  Then, using TDD I was able to step my way through each method to achieve the desired outcome.  Some of the test solutions came quickly, while others proved the effectiveness of TDD and how you can use it to break down your problem and truly work towards a solution.
